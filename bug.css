The CSS property `calc()` is used to perform calculations. However, there are some situations in which it might not work as expected. For instance, using `calc()` with multiple units that are not compatible can lead to unexpected behavior. For example, combining `px` and `em` in a single calculation might lead to incorrect results.  Another issue is related to operator precedence. It's important to ensure that the order of operations is correct, as `calc()` uses standard mathematical operator precedence.  If the parentheses are not correctly placed, you may encounter unexpected results. Finally, browser support for `calc()` can also be a factor, although most modern browsers support it fully, older browsers might have inconsistencies.
